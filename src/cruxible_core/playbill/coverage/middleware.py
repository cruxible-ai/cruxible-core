"""The owned/custom-harness coverage middleware (§11.7).

§11.7 names four adapter dispositions, and this is the one that owns its tool
executor: "before-tool, after-tool, and after-filesystem-change middleware
against the same operation contract." §11.8 points TauBench at exactly this
shape -- "where TauBench owns its tool executor, implement the adapter in the
benchmark harness against the vendor-neutral hook contract" -- which makes this
module, not the Claude Code plugin, the delivery mechanism for arm 4.

Why the middleware never writes to a model channel
--------------------------------------------------
The one thing this module deliberately does *not* do is splice. Every entry
point returns a :class:`CoverageDeliveryV1` carrying the original tool output
and the appended coverage text as two separate strings, and the caller joins
them. That is not squeamishness about strings: it is the §11.8 integrity rule
"original tool output is preserved and annotated, not replaced or suppressed"
made structural. A middleware that returned one blob could silently drop or
rewrite the tool's own output and no test could tell; a middleware that returns
the original *unmodified* alongside a pure addendum cannot, and the tests below
assert exactly that by comparing the returned original against the input.

It also keeps the module honest about a harness fact discovered while building
the Claude Code plugin: a vendor's tool-result channel may not be able to carry
free text at all. Splicing is a property of the harness, so it belongs to the
harness.

No semantic logic, enforced by what is in scope
-----------------------------------------------
Classification lives in the resolver and nowhere else. This module maps tool
events to `(logical source, optional byte window)` pairs through
:mod:`.adapter`, hands them to an injected resolve callable, and renders the
answer through :mod:`.render`. It never inspects a match state, never decides
equivalence, and never composes a coverage line of its own -- every byte it
emits came out of the reference renderer, including the one fail-open note.

The resolve callable is injected rather than imported because the coverage
package may not reach the service layer (an architecture test holds that line).
That constraint turned out to be the feature: the same middleware embeds in the
CLI, in TauBench's executor, and in any harness that can reach a Playbill
instance, because the only thing it needs from any of them is a function from
observations to a result.

Fail open on infrastructure, fail closed on semantics
------------------------------------------------------
An unreadable working file or an unreachable daemon must never break the
agent's tool call, so both degrade to the original output plus one note. But
nothing here ever manufactures a match state: a degraded delivery carries *no
cards at all*, and the guarantee that a degraded resolve cannot answer `exact`
stays where it already lives, in the resolver. The middleware has no code path
that could circumvent it because it has no code path that writes a card.

Unbound paths are silent
------------------------
A working path with no declared binding is not covered, and §11.6.4's rule
against context spam means it produces nothing: no card, no note, no mention.
Nothing false is said about it either -- an unbound path yields no span, so no
`none` is claimed inside a boundary that never contained it. The count is
recorded on the delivery for a harness that wants to measure configuration
coverage, and it is never rendered.
