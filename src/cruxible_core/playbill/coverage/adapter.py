"""The harness-facing half of coverage delivery: paths in, observations out.

§11.7 says adapters contain no semantic logic, and this module is where that
line is drawn rather than asserted. Everything here answers one of three
mechanical questions -- *which logical source is this working path?*, *what
bytes are currently there?*, and *which windows did the caller ask about?* --
and none of them can be answered by consulting accepted state. The resolver
never sees a filesystem path, and this module never sees a Claim.

Binding is declared, never inferred
-----------------------------------
A working path is bound to a `LogicalSourceIdentityV1` only by an explicit
declaration. Inferring one -- "the file is called `handbook.md` and the ledger
holds `documents/handbook.md`, so they must be the same source" -- is precisely
the mistake §11.6.1 exists to prevent: it would let identical bytes at a foreign
occurrence inherit governance by filename coincidence. An undeclared path is a
typed refusal, and two paths may never claim the same logical source, because a
working snapshot names each source at most once.

The five request forms
----------------------
§11.7 names five things one operation must resolve, and all five reduce to
`(logical source, optional byte window)` pairs before the resolver sees them:

* a file read with a line/range selection -- :func:`selection_for_lines`;
* a grep result batch -- :func:`observations_for_grep_hits`;
* a set of changed filesystem paths -- :func:`observe_working_paths`;
* an explicit source occurrence -- :func:`observe_working_source`;
* a working-set scope -- :func:`working_set_observations`.

Line numbers enter here and stop here. They are converted to byte windows
against the bytes the caller is actually looking at, and a byte window is a
presentation question about a region of a file, never part of an identity.

Bytes on the wire
-----------------
An observation carries its bytes base64-encoded because the two indexes cannot
be joined without them: an accepted commitment is a digest rather than a needle,
so finding cited content that moved requires hashing windows of the working
source, and only the side holding accepted state knows which lengths to look
for. The observation therefore re-verifies its own digest on construction --
a declared digest that does not reproduce from the declared bytes is refused
rather than believed.
