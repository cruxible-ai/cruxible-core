"""Author a recommendation once; derive Claims, retained input, and prose.

Application vocabulary example, not a generic SDK record API. The caller supplies
accepted typed Subject/ClaimType refs for two string-valued normative predicates.
The vocabulary must admit authored recommendations under its explicit evidence
policy. Acceptance records the recommendation; it does not adopt the policy.

Create with stage(pb, subject, fields, Recommendation(...)).prepare().submit().
Review intent.proposal through the ordinary governed workflow. After acceptance,
read the two fields from a fresh world and pass those ClaimViews to render().
Publish the resulting body using the existing block API. This renderer itself
does not produce a publication or Procedure execution receipt.

To revise, supply the previous typed record and exact Claim refs for changed
fields. Those refs must come from the coordinate used to read previous. The
helper never searches for, resolves, or silently replaces competing Claims.
