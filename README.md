**Shared truth for humans and agents.** Cruxible is a deterministic world-model runtime with DAG-based receipts.

Define entity graphs, queries, constraints, and governed workflows in YAML. Run them locally from CLI or MCP, and get receipts proving exactly why each result was returned.

LLMs do not expose a stable, shared internal state that other agents or humans can inspect or verify. Their judgments are prompt-local, frame-sensitive, and transient. Cruxible externalizes accepted facts, relationships, and judgments so work does not depend on drifting summaries or ephemeral model opinions.

## Why This Exists

Humans and agents do not naturally stay coherent with each other.

- Two agents can see similar material and still come away with different facts, procedures, or recommendations.
- A human can think something is settled while the model, under slightly different framing, behaves as if it is missing or softer than it really is.
- Handoffs through chat history are lossy. Important state gets re-summarized, re-interpreted, and sometimes silently changed.

Cruxible gives that important state a home outside the model:

- shared domain facts and relationships
- accepted judgments and review status
- named queries and constraints
- receipts explaining how results and proposals were produced

A simple way to think about it:

> LLMs can reason about truth, but they should not be the only place truth lives.

## Quick Example

**1. Define a domain in YAML:**

```yaml
entity_types:
  Drug:
    properties:
      drug_id: { type: string, primary_key: true }
      name:    { type: string }
  Enzyme:
    properties:
      enzyme_id: { type: string, primary_key: true }
      name:      { type: string }

relationships:
  - name: same_class
    from: Drug
    to: Drug
  - name: metabolized_by
    from: Drug
    to: Enzyme

named_queries:
  suggest_alternative:
    entry_point: Drug
    returns: Drug
    traversal:
      - relationship: same_class
        direction: both
      - relationship: metabolized_by
        direction: outgoing
```

**2. Load data and run a deterministic query:**

> "Suggest an alternative to simvastatin"

**3. Get a receipt — structured proof of every answer:**

*Raw receipt DAG rendered for readability:*

```
Receipt RCP-17b864830ada

Query: suggest_alternative for simvastatin

Step 1: Entry point lookup
  simvastatin -> found in graph

Step 2: Traverse same_class (both directions)
  Found 6 statins in the same therapeutic class:
  n3  atorvastatin   n4  rosuvastatin   n5  lovastatin
  n6  pravastatin    n7  fluvastatin    n8  pitavastatin

Step 3: Traverse metabolized_by (outgoing) for each alternative
  n9   atorvastatin -> CYP3A4   (CYP450 dataset)
  n10  rosuvastatin -> CYP2C9   (CYP450 dataset, human approved)
  n11  rosuvastatin -> CYP2C19  (CYP450 dataset)
  n12  lovastatin -> CYP2C19    (CYP450 dataset)
  n13  lovastatin -> CYP3A4     (CYP450 dataset)
  n14  pravastatin -> CYP3A4    (CYP450 dataset)
  n15  fluvastatin -> CYP2C9    (CYP450 dataset)
  n16  fluvastatin -> CYP2D6    (CYP450 dataset)
  n17  pitavastatin -> CYP2C9   (CYP450 dataset)

Results: atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin
Duration: 0.41ms | 2 traversal steps
```

## Get Started

### Choose a Mode

- **Local daemon:** recommended for the `0.2` release candidate. Run `cruxible-server` on `127.0.0.1` or a Unix socket, then point the CLI, GUI, or agent tools at that daemon.
- **Direct local runtime:** still supported as a convenience path for development and single-user exploration, but it is not the primary RC story and it is not a hard isolation boundary.

### Local Daemon Runtime

```bash
pip install "cruxible-core[server,mcp]"
CRUXIBLE_SERVER_STATE_DIR="$HOME/.cruxible/server" cruxible-server
```

> Or use `uv tool install "cruxible-core[mcp]"` if you prefer [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

By default the daemon is local-only and binds to `127.0.0.1:8100`. If you want a simple local hardening layer, add `CRUXIBLE_SERVER_AUTH=true` and `CRUXIBLE_SERVER_TOKEN=...`.

### Connect the CLI or GUI

```bash
cruxible --server-url http://127.0.0.1:8100 init \
  --root-dir "$(pwd)" \
  --config config.yaml
```

The returned `instance_id` is the handle the CLI, GUI, and local integrations use for later queries, workflows, and mutations.

### Client-Only Agent Environment

```bash
pip install cruxible-client
```

Use `cruxible-client` when the caller only needs typed HTTP/API access to a separate Cruxible daemon.

Permission modes are enforced at the daemon boundary. If an agent can import `cruxible-core` or access the same runtime/filesystem directly, those modes are advisory rather than isolating. If trust levels matter, keep `cruxible-core` out of the agent environment and talk to a separate daemon through `cruxible-client`.

For the `0.2` RC, the daemon-backed API is the primary interface for the CLI, GUI, and local integrations. Direct local runtime remains available as a convenience path.

For agent setups, prefer:

- `cruxible-client` in the agent environment
- `cruxible-core` in a separate daemon/runtime environment
- `CRUXIBLE_REQUIRE_SERVER=1` in the agent environment
- daemon state outside the agent workspace

For a concrete hardened setup, see [Isolated Deployment](docs/isolated-deployment.md).

### MCP Setup

Add the MCP server to your AI agent:

**Claude Code / Cursor** (project `.mcp.json` or `~/.claude.json` / `.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cruxible": {
      "command": "cruxible-mcp",
      "env": {
        "CRUXIBLE_MODE": "admin",
        "CRUXIBLE_SERVER_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8100"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Codex** (`~/.codex/config.toml`):

```toml
[mcp_servers.cruxible]
command = "cruxible-mcp"

[mcp_servers.cruxible.env]
CRUXIBLE_MODE = "admin"
CRUXIBLE_SERVER_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8100"
```

### Try a demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cruxible-ai/cruxible-core
cd cruxible-core/demos/drug-interactions
```

Each demo is a starter kit with a config, prebuilt graph, example queries, and receipts. If you're new, start with `drug-interactions`.

Treat the demo flow as local evaluation mode. For a real process boundary, run against a separate daemon instead of relying on a same-machine local runtime boundary.

First, load the instance:

> "You have access to the cruxible MCP, load the cruxible instance"

Then try:

- "Check interactions for warfarin"
- "What's the enzyme impact of fluoxetine?"
- "Suggest an alternative to simvastatin"

Every query produces a receipt you can inspect.

## Why Not Just Use Prompts, Docs, or Memory?

Prompts, markdown playbooks, tickets, and generic memory layers are good at storing context.

They are bad at storing hard state.

Hard state is the part that should not change just because a different agent saw different context, summarized things differently, or framed the problem another way.

Use memory for:

- temporary notes
- working context
- recall and retrieval
- loose guidance

Use Cruxible for:

- accepted facts and relationships
- accepted judgments and review status
- explicit operational procedure through queries, constraints, workflows, and policies
- receipts and provenance explaining how results and proposals were produced

Cruxible is for the cases where humans and agents need to coordinate around shared truth instead of around temporary summaries.

## Why Cruxible

| Prompts, docs, or memory alone | With Cruxible |
|---|---|
| Facts and decisions get re-summarized on every handoff | Accepted facts and judgments persist as hard state |
| Procedure lives in markdown, habits, and chat context | Queries, constraints, workflows, and policies are explicit |
| Different framing can produce different "truth" | The same state produces the same result |
| Review is social and informal | Review status is part of the model |
| Provenance is scattered across chats and tools | DAG-based receipts explain every result and proposal |
| Memory helps recall | Hard state supports coordination and trust |

## Features

- **Receipt-based provenance:** every query produces a DAG-structured proof showing exactly how the answer was derived.
- **Constraint system:** define validation rules that are checked by `evaluate`. Feedback patterns can be encoded as constraints.
- **Feedback loop:** approve, reject, correct, or flag individual edges. Rejected edges are excluded from future queries.
- **Candidate detection:** property matching and shared-neighbor strategies for discovering missing relationships at scale.
- **YAML-driven config:** define entity types, relationships, queries, constraints, and ingestion mappings in one file.
- **Zero LLM dependencies:** purely deterministic runtime. No API keys, no token costs during execution.
- **Full MCP server:** complete lifecycle via [Model Context Protocol](docs/mcp-tools.md) for AI agent orchestration.
- **CLI mirror:** core MCP tools have [CLI equivalents](docs/cli-reference.md) for terminal workflows.
- **Permission modes:** READ_ONLY, GRAPH_WRITE, ADMIN tiers control what tools a session can access.
