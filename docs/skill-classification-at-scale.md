# Skill: Classification at Scale

Classify entities from an internal catalog against a standard taxonomy using deterministic integrations, batch group review, and a trust flywheel. LLM reasoning is limited to writing configs, handling ambiguous tails, and critiquing results.

## When to use this skill

You have two datasets:
- An **internal catalog** with free-text descriptions and informal categories
- A **standard taxonomy** with structured types/categories

You need to create classification edges between them — at scale, with receipts, and with minimal ongoing human review.

## Architecture boundary

```
You (the agent):
  - Write the config (entity types, integrations, matching policy)
  - Build or invoke deterministic integrations (regex, lookup tables, rules)
  - Run integrations against entities to produce structured extractions
  - Convert extraction results to tri-state signals (support/unsure/contradict)
  - Propose groups with thesis_facts derived from extractions
  - Run the review loop (sample, critique, refine rules, regroup)

Core:
  - Stores integration identity and contract (the spec of record)
  - Validates signals against matching policy
  - Derives review priority from signal + trust state
  - Manages group lifecycle (propose → resolve → trust)
  - Produces receipts for every mutation
  - Gates auto-resolve on thesis-scoped trust

Core does NOT execute integrations. The contract field is a specification,
not an implementation. You read the contract and run it.
```

## Phase 1: Understand the data

Before writing any config, profile both datasets.

```
1. Read headers, row counts, sample rows from both files
2. Identify primary keys (catalog part number, taxonomy type ID)
3. Profile the description fields — look for shorthand patterns, abbreviations
4. Count distinct categories/subcategories on both sides
5. Look for existing classification columns (may be partially populated)
6. Identify junk rows (discontinued, dropbox, test data)
```

The description profiling is critical. Catalog shorthand has structure:

```
"65-66 MUST FB RR QTR TRIM 5PC"
 ^^^^  ^^^^ ^^ ^^ ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^
 year  car  body pos part type count

Extract the part noun and qualifiers — these drive both matching and grouping.
```

## Phase 2: Write the config

### Entity types

One entity type per dataset. Properties should capture everything needed for matching — descriptions, categories, subcategories.

```yaml
entity_types:
  CatalogPart:
    properties:
      part_number:
        type: string
        primary_key: true
      short_desc:
        type: string
      long_desc:
        type: string
        optional: true
      category:
        type: string
        optional: true
      sub_category:
        type: string
        optional: true

  TaxonomyType:
    properties:
      type_id:
        type: string
        primary_key: true
      type_name:
        type: string
      category_name:
        type: string
      sub_category_name:
        type: string
```

### Integrations

Declare each deterministic integration with a contract that fully specifies its rules. The contract is the source of truth for what the integration is supposed to do. If an external integration faithfully implements that contract and is deterministic, re-running it against the same entity should produce the same signal.

```yaml
integrations:
  keyword_extract_v1:
    kind: regex_classifier
    contract:
      version: "1.0"
      source_fields: ["short_desc", "long_desc"]
      rules:
        - name: quarter_panel
          patterns: ["QTR TRIM", "QUARTER TRIM", "QTR PNL", "QUARTER PANEL"]
          extracts: {part_noun: "trim_panel", qualifier: "quarter"}
        - name: door_panel
          patterns: ["DR PNL", "DOOR PANEL", "INT DR TRIM", "DOOR INT"]
          extracts: {part_noun: "door_panel", qualifier: "interior"}
        - name: floor_carpet
          patterns: ["CPT", "CARPET", "PILE CPT", "CT PILE"]
          extracts: {part_noun: "carpet", qualifier: "floor"}
        - name: molding
          patterns: ["MLDG", "MOLDING", "MOULDING"]
          extracts: {part_noun: "molding"}
      fallback: unsure
    notes: >
      Deterministic regex extraction against catalog shorthand.
      Agent or external tool reads this contract and executes it.
      New rules are added through config updates (keyword_extract_v2, etc).

  category_map_v1:
    kind: lookup_table
    contract:
      version: "1.0"
      from_fields: ["category", "sub_category"]
      to_field: type_id
      mappings:
        "Interior Soft Goods/Door Panels & Components": ["10006", "12730", "11409"]
        "Interior Soft Goods/Carpet": ["1264"]
        "Body Components/Hardware": ["11409", "11416"]
      fallback: unsure
    notes: >
      Maps catalog category/sub_category pairs to candidate taxonomy type IDs.
      Combined with keyword extraction to select final match.

  llm_review_v1:
    kind: generic
    contract:
      use_when: "keyword_extract returns unsure OR category_map has >3 candidates after keyword narrowing"
    notes: >
      LLM fallback for the ambiguous tail. Only invoked when deterministic
      integrations cannot produce a confident signal.
```

### Relationship with matching policy

```yaml
relationships:
  - name: classified_as
    from: CatalogPart
    to: TaxonomyType
    properties:
      confidence_basis:
        type: string
      match_detail:
        type: string
        optional: true
    matching:
      integrations:
        keyword_extract_v1:
          role: required
        category_map_v1:
          role: required
        llm_review_v1:
          role: advisory
          always_review_on_unsure: true
      auto_resolve_when: all_support
      auto_resolve_requires_prior_trust: trusted_only
      max_group_size: 200
```

This policy means:
- Every group member must have signals from `keyword_extract_v1` and `category_map_v1`
- `llm_review_v1` is advisory — its signal is recorded but doesn't gate approval
- If the LLM returns `unsure`, the group gets `always_review_on_unsure` escalation
- Auto-resolve requires all signals `support` AND a prior `trusted` resolution for the same signature

### Ingestion mappings

```yaml
ingestion:
  catalog_parts:
    entity_type: CatalogPart
    id_column: "Detroit P/N"
    column_map:
      "ShortDesc (Max 30)": short_desc
      LongDesc: long_desc
      Category: category
      "Sub-Category": sub_category

  taxonomy_types:
    entity_type: TaxonomyType
    id_column: PartTypeId
    column_map:
      PartTypeName: type_name
      CategoryName: category_name
      SubCategoryName: sub_category_name
```

## Phase 3: Ingest

```
cruxible_validate(config_path="config.yaml")
cruxible_init(root_dir=".", config_path="config.yaml")
cruxible_ingest(instance_id, "taxonomy_types", file_path="taxonomy.csv")
cruxible_ingest(instance_id, "catalog_parts", file_path="catalog.csv")
```

Both ingestions produce mutation receipts with config digests.

## Phase 4: Run integrations and build signals

Read the integration contracts from the config. Execute each one deterministically against the catalog entities. Core doesn't do this — you do.

### Step 1: Run keyword extraction

Read `keyword_extract_v1.contract.rules`. For each CatalogPart, apply patterns against `short_desc` and `long_desc`:

```
Part 31112C: "65-66 MUST FB RR QTR TRIM 5PC"
  → matches rule "quarter_panel"
  → extraction: {part_noun: "trim_panel", qualifier: "quarter"}
  → signal: support

Part B1803P42: "77-78 2DR MODELS LGHT GRN C/P"
  → no rule matches
  → signal: unsure
```

### Step 2: Run category mapping

Read `category_map_v1.contract.mappings`. For each CatalogPart, look up its category/sub_category:

```
Part 31112C: category="Interior Soft Goods", sub_category="Door Panels & Components"
  → candidates: [10006, 12730, 11409]
  → cross-reference with extraction qualifier "quarter" → narrows to 12730
  → signal: support

Part with category="#Dropbox"
  → no mapping
  → signal: unsure
```

### Step 3: LLM only for unsure cases

Check the `llm_review_v1.contract.use_when` condition. Only invoke LLM for parts where keyword extraction returned `unsure` OR category mapping left >3 candidates.

For the rest — the parts where both deterministic integrations returned `support` — no LLM call is needed.

### Step 4: Build member signal lists

Each member needs signals from every required integration:

```python
member = {
    "from_type": "CatalogPart",
    "from_id": "31112C",
    "to_type": "TaxonomyType",
    "to_id": "12730",
    "relationship_type": "classified_as",
    "signals": [
        {"integration": "keyword_extract_v1", "signal": "support",
         "evidence": "matched rule quarter_panel: part_noun=trim_panel qualifier=quarter"},
        {"integration": "category_map_v1", "signal": "support",
         "evidence": "Interior Soft Goods/Door Panels → [10006,12730,11409] narrowed by qualifier=quarter"},
    ],
    "properties": {"confidence_basis": "keyword+category", "match_detail": "quarter_panel→12730"}
}
```

## Phase 5: Group and propose

Group members by their **extracted features** — these become `thesis_facts` and determine the signature. Same thesis_facts = same signature = same trust track.

### Choosing the grouping key

Group by the combination of fields that represents a repeatable matching pattern:

```
thesis_facts: {
    "part_noun": "trim_panel",
    "qualifier": "quarter",
    "target_type_id": "12730"
}
```

All "quarter trim panels classified as taxonomy type 12730" share a signature. This means:
- They get reviewed as one batch (not individually)
- Trust earned on this group applies to future batches with the same pattern
- If trust is invalidated, all future batches of this pattern go back to review

### Seed-then-fan-out

If a signature has more members than `max_group_size`, you'll need multiple
chunks. **Do not propose all chunks at once.** Core checks for trusted prior
resolutions at proposal time. If no trust exists yet, every chunk lands as
`pending_review` and you'd have to manually resolve each one — completely
defeating the flywheel.

The right pattern:

1. **Propose a few seed chunks** per unique signature — enough to get
   diversity for spot-checking (2-3 chunks, not all of them).
2. **Resolve the seeds** — review the thesis, inspect sample members, approve.
3. **Spot-check edges across the resolved seeds**, promote to trusted
   (see Phase 7).
4. **Then propose the remaining chunks** for that signature. Core finds the
   prior trusted resolution → `auto_resolved`. You just call resolve to
   write the edges.

This makes the first run dramatically cheaper. Instead of reviewing 65
identical floor-carpet groups, you review ~15-20 unique signatures and the
rest auto-resolve.

### Propose a group

```
cruxible_propose_group(
    instance_id,
    relationship_type="classified_as",
    members=[...list of members with signals...],
    thesis_text="Quarter trim panel parts classified as TaxonomyType 12730",
    thesis_facts={"part_noun": "trim_panel", "qualifier": "quarter", "target_type_id": "12730"},
    analysis_state={
        "extraction_version": "keyword_extract_v1",
        "category_map_version": "category_map_v1",
        "member_count": 45,
        "unsure_count": 2,
        "sample_parts": ["31112C", "K1960", "62118E"]
    },
    integrations_used=["keyword_extract_v1", "category_map_v1"]
)
```

`analysis_state` is opaque to Core — it's NOT hashed into the signature. Use
it to stash extraction context, LLM reasoning, and anything an agent might
need when revisiting this group later. It's returned by `cruxible_get_group`
and `cruxible_list_resolutions`.

### What Core does with the proposal

Core checks:
1. All required integration signals present on every member
2. `max_group_size` not exceeded
3. No duplicate members
4. Signal values from declared integrations only

Then derives `review_priority`:
- Blocking integration contradicts → `critical`
- Prior trust invalidated → `critical`
- Unsure on required integration → `review`
- No prior resolution → `review`
- Everything clean + prior trusted → auto-resolve eligible

If auto-resolve conditions are met (all support + prior trusted), group status
is set to `auto_resolved`. Otherwise `pending_review`.

## Phase 6: Resolve seed groups

```
cruxible_list_groups(instance_id, relationship_type="classified_as", status="pending_review")
```

Groups are sorted by review_priority (critical first). For each seed group:

```
cruxible_get_group(instance_id, group_id)
```

Returns the thesis, members with signals, and review_priority. Review the
thesis and sample members, then resolve:

```
cruxible_resolve_group(instance_id, group_id, action="approve",
    rationale="Quarter trim panel mapping verified against PIES taxonomy")
```

This creates classification edges for all valid members, with receipts and
provenance.

## Phase 7: Review, trust, and fan out

After resolving seed groups, verify the edges before promoting to trusted.
The flywheel works *within* the first run — not just on future refreshes.

### Spot-check edges

Scale the check count to the blast radius — trusting a signature that covers
3,000 edges based on 10 checks is reckless. Pull samples **across multiple
resolved groups** for the same signature, not just from one seed.

```
| Total edges for signature | Minimum spot-checks | Pull from          |
|---------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| < 50                      | 5                   | single group is ok |
| 50 – 500                  | 10-15               | 2+ groups          |
| 500 – 5,000               | 20-30               | 3+ groups          |
| > 5,000                   | 40-50               | all resolved seeds |
```

For each sampled member:

```
cruxible_get_relationship(instance_id,
    from_type="CatalogPart", from_id="31112C",
    relationship="classified_as",
    to_type="TaxonomyType", to_id="12730")

cruxible_get_entity(instance_id, "CatalogPart", "31112C")
```

### Critique with LLM

Send the sample to an LLM with the thesis and ask: "Are these classifications
correct given the part descriptions and the taxonomy type?"

### If correct — promote to trusted and fan out

```
cruxible_update_trust_status(instance_id, resolution_id, "trusted",
    reason="Spot-checked 25 edges across 3 groups, all correct")
```

Now propose the remaining chunks for this signature. Core finds the prior
trusted resolution → `auto_resolved`:

```
# Propose remaining chunks — they auto-resolve
for chunk in remaining_chunks_for_signature:
    cruxible_propose_group(instance_id, "classified_as",
        members=chunk, thesis_facts=same_thesis_facts, ...)

# Write the edges
cruxible_list_groups(instance_id, status="auto_resolved")
# For each:
cruxible_resolve_group(instance_id, group_id, action="approve",
    rationale="Auto-resolved: prior trusted pattern")
```

### If errors found — fix and regroup

```
# 1. Reject misclassified edges
cruxible_feedback(
    instance_id,
    receipt_id=<resolve_receipt>,
    action="reject",
    source="agent",
    from_type="CatalogPart",
    from_id="31112C",
    relationship="classified_as",
    to_type="TaxonomyType",
    to_id="10006",
    reason="Quarter panel, not door panel — description says QTR TRIM",
)

# 2. Invalidate trust on the pattern
cruxible_update_trust_status(instance_id, resolution_id, "invalidated",
    reason="Mixed quarter/door panels in group — need finer keyword split")
```

Refine the integration contract:

```yaml
# Add to keyword_extract_v1 (or create keyword_extract_v2):
rules:
  - name: quarter_panel
    patterns: ["QTR TRIM", "QUARTER TRIM", "QTR PNL"]
    extracts: {part_noun: "trim_panel", qualifier: "quarter"}
  - name: door_panel
    patterns: ["DR PNL", "DOOR PANEL", "INT DR TRIM"]
    not_patterns: ["QTR", "QUARTER"]     # exclude quarter panels
    extracts: {part_noun: "door_panel", qualifier: "interior"}
```

Re-run the extraction with the updated rules. Propose new groups with finer
thesis_facts:

```
cruxible_propose_group(instance_id, "classified_as",
    members=[...formerly misclassified parts...],
    thesis_facts={"part_noun": "trim_panel", "qualifier": "quarter", "target_type_id": "12730"})
```

Each iteration of this loop:
1. Shrinks the ambiguous tail
2. Adds rules to the integration contract
3. Produces more specific thesis signatures
4. Builds trust on verified patterns

## Phase 8: Ongoing trust flywheel

The same flywheel that works within the first run also works across data
refreshes:

```
New catalog refresh arrives → ingest new parts
Agent runs same integrations (same contract) → same extraction
Agent proposes group with same thesis_facts → same signature
Core finds prior trusted resolution → auto_resolved
Agent calls resolve → edges created, no human review needed
```

The flywheel breaks only when trust is invalidated — which sends the pattern
back to review with `critical` priority.

## Integration versioning

When you change integration rules, declare a new version:

```yaml
integrations:
  keyword_extract_v1:
    # ... original rules (kept for audit trail)
  keyword_extract_v2:
    kind: regex_classifier
    contract:
      version: "2.0"
      # ... updated rules with finer patterns
```

Update the relationship's matching section to reference v2. Old groups still reference v1 in their `integrations_used`, and old resolutions preserve the thesis, trust status, and analysis_state produced under the earlier run. That preserves the audit trail even though the resolution row does not store `integrations_used` directly.

The signature is stable across integration versions (it's thesis_facts, not integration version). Trust earned under v1 carries forward to v2 proposals with the same thesis_facts. If v2 changes the extraction logic enough to produce different thesis_facts, that's a new signature with its own trust track — which is correct behavior.

## Anti-patterns

- **Running LLM classification on every part** — Build deterministic rules first. LLM is for the tail, not the bulk.
- **Putting extraction logic inside Core** — Core governs signals, it doesn't execute integrations. Keep matching logic in external tools.
- **Grouping too coarsely** — "All interior parts → PIES Body" is too broad. Group by extracted part noun + qualifier for meaningful trust boundaries.
- **Grouping too finely** — One part per group defeats batch review. Group by the repeatable pattern, not the individual part.
- **Skipping `analysis_state`** — Stash your extraction context, LLM reasoning, and candidate scores. Future agents (or your future self) will need it when revisiting resolutions.
- **Trusting immediately** — Start at `watch`. Promote to `trusted` after spot-checking edges from the resolved group. The trust flywheel earns speed through verified accuracy.
- **Changing contract without versioning** — Modifying `keyword_extract_v1.contract` in place breaks the audit trail. Declare v2 instead.
