# Cruxible Kits

Kits are maintained Cruxible world models intended to be used, forked, and
iterated with agents. Each kit includes a YAML config and a README with generated
views for the ontology, governed relationships, workflows, and named queries.

## Maintained Kits

| Kit | Domain | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [kev-triage](kev-triage/) | Cybersecurity | KEV reference and internal asset triage workflows. |
| [supply-chain-blast-radius](supply-chain-blast-radius/) | Supply Chain | Supplier, component, product, shipment, and incident blast-radius modeling. |
| [case-law-monitoring](case-law-monitoring/) | Legal | Matter-centered case-law monitoring and authority impact modeling. |
| [retail-catalog](retail-catalog/) | Retail | Product catalog relationships, substitutes, complements, and downstream retail planning surfaces. |

## Working With A Kit

Use the generated README views as the review surface while drafting or fitting a
kit. Regenerate them after config changes:

```bash
uv run cruxible config-views --config kits/<kit>/config.yaml --update-readme kits/<kit>/README.md
```

For layered kits such as KEV triage, include `--runtime` so generated views use
the composed runtime config.

When rendering a runtime wiki for a layered kit, use local scope so only the
local world state plus directly used upstream context is emitted:

```bash
uv run cruxible render-wiki --output wiki --scope local
```
